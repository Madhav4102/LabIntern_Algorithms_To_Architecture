# LabIntern_Algorithms_To_Architecture

This repository contains the code and result videos of the work I have done during my time as a Lab Intern at the Algorithms to Architecture Lab at Indraprastha Insitute of Information Technology Delhi.

I primarily worked on programming RFSoc FPGA using Python to develop interactive interfaces for hardware projects making them more user-friendly.

My Primary Work :
The Radar folder consists of videos showcasing the GUI programmed for a hardware system involving wireless transmission using Golay Sequence based on RFSoc and Seivers Module.
